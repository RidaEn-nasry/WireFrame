# WireFrame


This project was an introduction to “events” programming basically was about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in French,
hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points
(x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as
a parameter to the executable.

In this project i discovered the basics of graphic programming, and in particular
how to place points in space, how to join them with segments, and most importantly how
to observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.


Here is an example:
